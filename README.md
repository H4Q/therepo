This is team Bonobos' repo for the 2015 hackathon Hack For Sweden. The essential idea is to gather popular statistics from authorities such as Statistiska centralbyr√•n, and present them in a intuitive, user-friendly manner. The answer to your common question should just a [insert favorite search engine] search away.

Some quick remarks of our stack:

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is powering the back end. We're using a number of Flask extensions, such as Flask SQLAlchemy and Flask Migrate.
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) is our DBMS of choice.
* Bootstrap/Bootswatch for rapid front end prototyping.
* Grunt for handling static assets locally.
* Amazon S3 for storing images.
* Google Drive for storing data.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for deployment.
